| Global: | N/A | Not applicable - this is a Regional initiative. Global team provides product messaging framework and compliance guidelines but does not create campaign assets. |
| Regional: | Hans Mueller (EMEA Lead) | **Invents** full EMEA Financial Services campaign from ground up. EMEA creates all assets tailored to European financial services regulations (MiFID II, PSD2), creates industry-specific messaging, produces customer case studies with European banks, and develops compliance-first positioning. Campaign addresses unique EMEA needs: Brexit impact, ECB digital euro, and fragmented market structure. |
| Local: | Julia Schmidt (DACH), Pierre Dubois (France), Marco Bianchi (Italy), Emma Wilson (UK&I), Anna Kowalski (CEE) | **Adapt** - Local teams translate and culturally adapt regional campaign. DACH emphasizes engineering excellence and security certifications. France highlights data sovereignty and local hosting. UK focuses on post-Brexit financial innovation. Italy adapts for relationship-based sales culture. CEE creates separate emerging markets messaging. Each market adds local compliance requirements and bank references. |
