| Geography | Lead Name | Notes (Adopt/Adapt/Invent) |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------------|
| Global: | Derek Johnson | **Creates** 12-part content series in English: written guides (5,000+ words each), video tutorials (15-20 min), code repositories, and interactive diagrams. Global team produces all primary content featuring cloud architects from our solutions team. Content covers universal cloud architecture patterns applicable globally. Creates promotion toolkit. |
| Regional: | Sarah O'Brien (EMEA), Ravi Kumar (APAC), Carlos Mendez (LATAM) | **Adapt** - Regional teams translate written content (10 languages total) and add localized video subtitles. EMEA adds compliance sections (GDPR, data residency). APAC includes examples using popular regional cloud providers for hybrid scenarios. LATAM creates simplified "getting started" versions for emerging market audience. Each region adds 2-3 regional guest architects for local credibility. |
| Local: | Country content leads | **Adopt** - Local teams promote regional content through local channels. Use regional translations as-is. Local teams identify relevant local communities (Stack Overflow, local dev forums) for distribution. Japan adds integration with local tech blog platforms. Germany creates accompanying podcast episodes. |

**Marketing objectives:** Support annual Content Marketing OKR: Drive 500K technical content engagements, generate 50K MQLs from technical content, achieve #1 ranking for 20 cloud architecture keywords. Position company as thought leader in cloud architecture education.

Content designed to educate and generate qualified leads from technical decision-makers. Runs January-December 2024 (monthly releases).

**Audience:** Primary: Cloud architects and senior developers at mid-to-large companies (500+ employees) designing scalable systems. 5-15 years experience, care about: best practices, real-world examples, avoiding costly mistakes, career development. Secondary: Engineering leaders evaluating cloud platforms and architecture approaches. They care about: team enablement, reducing technical debt, proven patterns.

**Key messages:**
1. Master cloud architecture patterns with real-world examples from top companies
2. From theory to production: complete code repos and deployment templates included
3. Learn from architects who've scaled systems to millions of users
4. Free, comprehensive education to advance your architecture skills
