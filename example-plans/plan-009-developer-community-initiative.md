| Geography | Lead Name | Notes (Adopt/Adapt/Invent) |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------------|
| Global: | Samantha Reed | **Creates** community program framework, contribution guidelines, open source governance model, and global community initiatives. Global team maintains core open source projects (5 major repos), creates contributor onboarding resources, manages global community events (online), and develops ambassador program structure. Owns GitHub org strategy and community metrics dashboard. |
| Regional: | N/A | Not applicable - Open source communities are naturally global and self-organizing. Regional developer advocates participate in global community, but don't create regional versions. |
| Local: | Developer advocates in key cities | **Adopt** - Local developer advocates support global community by hosting local meetups, participating in global projects, and recruiting local contributors. They use global resources as-is and feed local insights back to global team. Local advocates organize community presence at local conferences. No local adaptation of open source code or community programs. |

**Marketing objectives:** Support Developer Platform OKR: Grow active contributor community from 5,000 to 15,000 developers. Achieve 50K GitHub stars across flagship projects. Drive 30% of platform improvements from community contributions. Build thriving ecosystem of 200+ community-maintained extensions.

**Project description:** Comprehensive open source community program to grow, engage, and empower developer contributors. Includes open source projects, contribution incentives, community events, ambassador program, and ecosystem development. Focus on building sustainable community that drives platform innovation and adoption.

**Audience:** Open source developers globally - individual contributors, maintainers, and passionate technologists. Range from students to senior engineers. They care about: solving interesting problems, career growth, recognition, learning from peers, giving back to community. Companies benefit from free tools, ability to customize, and avoiding vendor lock-in.

**Key messages:**
1. Build the future of developer tools with us - 15K developers contributing daily
2. Your code matters: 40% of our roadmap comes from community ideas
3. From first PR to core maintainer - we invest in your growth
4. Open source, open community, open future - join us
