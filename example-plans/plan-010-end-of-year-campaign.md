| Geography | Lead Name | Notes (Adopt/Adapt/Invent) |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------------|
| Global: | Brian Foster | **Creates** year-end campaign strategy, sales plays, promotional offers framework, and campaign toolkit. Global develops account-based marketing (ABM) target list methodology, intent signal scoring, and campaign automation. Creates core campaign messaging around "start 2025 strong", year-end budget urgency, and multi-year deal incentives. Produces global email templates and sales enablement materials. |
| Regional: | Jessica Liu (Americas), Pierre Martin (EMEA), Akira Tanaka (APAC) | **Adapt** - Regional teams adapt campaign timing for fiscal year calendars (many EMEA companies on calendar year, APAC varies). Americas emphasizes Thanksgiving-Christmas urgency. EMEA focuses on December budget flush and January budget availability. APAC adjusts for Lunar New Year (Feb 2025) planning cycles. Each region adapts offers for local deal sizes and payment terms. Regional teams customize intent signals for local competitors and buying behaviors. |
| Local: | Country sales teams | **Adopt** - Local sales teams execute regional campaign plays using provided toolkits. Use regional email templates, call scripts, and ABM tactics as-is. Local teams add country-specific urgency (end of fiscal year, local holidays) in sales conversations. BDRs follow regional outbound cadences. |

**Marketing objectives:** Support Q4 Revenue OKR: Close $120M in Q4 bookings (40% of annual target). Drive $200M in pipeline creation for Q1/Q2 close. Achieve 35% win rate on year-end deals. Secure 50% of annual quota in multi-year commitments.

**Project description:** Intensive 10-week sales acceleration campaign targeting in-market accounts with year-end urgency, budget availability, and buying intent signals. Multi-channel ABM approach combining targeted advertising, personalized outreach, executive engagement, and limited-time incentives. Focus on pipeline acceleration and deal closing.

**Audience:** Primary: In-market accounts (500+ employees) showing buying intent signals - budget holders making year-end decisions. VP/C-level in IT, Engineering, Operations. They care about: using remaining budget, starting new fiscal year strong, locking in favorable pricing. Secondary: Existing pipeline opportunities (created in Q2/Q3) ready to close.

**Key messages:**
1. Start 2025 stronger: Deploy in January, impact in Q1, ROI by June
2. Limited time: Lock in 2024 pricing + get 20% more value with annual commit
3. Join 500+ companies who made the smart move before year-end
4. Your 2025 success starts with a Q4 decision - let's make it happen
