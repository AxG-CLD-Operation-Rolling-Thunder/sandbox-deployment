|-----------|-----------|----------------------------|
| Global: | Michael Rodriguez | **Creates** all core campaign assets (hero video, key messages, web pages). Global team develops messaging framework and brand guidelines for product launch. Campaign runs in English across all global channels. |
| Regional: | Emma Watson (EMEA), Yuki Tanaka (APAC), Carlos Silva (LATAM) | **Adapt** - Regional teams translate and culturally adapt global assets.
