| Regional: | Sophia Rossi (EMEA), Raj Malhotra (India), Chen Wei (China) | **Adapt** - Regional teams translate all content and adapt demos with region-relevant code examples. India adapts messaging to emphasize cost efficiency (popular in market). China team adapts for local IDE integrations (JetBrains popular). EMEA adjusts data privacy messaging for GDPR context. Each region records localized demo videos with regional developer advocates. |
| Local: | Country developer advocates | **Adopt** - Local teams adopt regional content as-is. Exception: Brazil creates additional Portuguese tutorial content due to strong developer community. Japan adds integration examples with local frameworks. |

**Marketing objectives:** Support Q3 Product Innovation OKR: Drive 100K CodeAssist activations in first 60 days. Achieve 40% adoption rate among existing IDE users. Generate 25,000 qualified leads for enterprise AI offering.

**Project description:** Launch of CodeAssist AI, our intelligent code completion and generation tool integrated into popular IDEs. AI-powered feature helps developers write code faster with context-aware suggestions, automatic documentation, and bug detection. Available as freemium (individuals) and paid tier (teams/enterprise).

**Audience:** Primary: Professional software developers using VS Code, IntelliJ, or PyCharm (2M existing users in our ecosystem). They care about: productivity gains, code quality, learning new languages/frameworks faster. Secondary: Engineering managers at companies evaluating AI coding tools for their teams (budget authority, care about ROI and security).

**Key messages:**
1. Write code 10x faster with AI that understands your entire codebase
2. From idea to working code in seconds, not hours
3. Secure, enterprise-ready AI trained on permissively-licensed code only
4. Free for individuals, flexible plans for teams - start coding smarter today

**Investment:** $320K (product marketing: $120K, paid media: $150K, events/webinars: $50K) + 7 FTEs
